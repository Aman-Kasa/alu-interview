# Rainwater Retention

This project provides a Python implementation of a function to calculate the amount of rainwater retained between walls of varying heights.

## Description

The `rain` function takes a list of non-negative integers representing wall heights and calculates how many square units of water can be trapped after a rain.

### Example:

```python
walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
print(rain(walls))  # Output: 6
